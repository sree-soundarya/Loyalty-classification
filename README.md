# Loyalty-classification and RFM Analysis with Snowflake and ThoughtSpot

## Introduction

Customer segmentation and loyalty classification play a crucial role in understanding and optimizing customer relationships. In this project, we leverage Banking and Transaction data to perform loyalty classification and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The entire process is implemented using Snowflake Snowpark Python, and the results are visualized using ThoughtSpot.

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for conducting loyalty classification and RFM analysis using Snowflake and ThoughtSpot. The process involves extracting valuable insights from Banking and Transaction data to classify customers based on their loyalty and conduct RFM analysis to understand their behavior.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preparation

We begin by cleaning and preparing the data, ensuring it's suitable for analysis. This step includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and organizing the data for subsequent stages.

### 2. Loyalty Classification

Utilizing Snowflake Snowpark Python, we implement a robust loyalty classification algorithm. This algorithm assesses customer behavior, identifying patterns that help categorize customers into loyalty segments.

### 3. RFM Analysis

The RFM analysis involves evaluating three key aspects: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of customer transactions. This information is crucial for understanding customer engagement and tailoring strategies accordingly.

### 4. Visualization with ThoughtSpot

To make the results accessible and actionable, we leverage ThoughtSpot for visualization. We establish a live Snowflake connection on ThoughtSpot, creating worksheets using Snowflake tables. Additionally, we develop a liveboard on ThoughtSpot to dynamically visualize and interact with the loyalty classification and RFM analysis results.

## Results

The results of this analysis provide comprehensive insights into customer behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making for marketing, engagement, and loyalty strategies. The visualizations in ThoughtSpot enhance the interpretability of the findings, making it accessible for various stakeholders.
